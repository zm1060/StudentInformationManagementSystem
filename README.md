A project with GTK and Sqlite3


Firstly, you need to download Sqlite3 and GTK.
If you use ubuntu, you can run these commands.


For  Sqlite3
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
```
then, you can use this to see whether you have downloaded it:
```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

For GTK

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```



This is just a model.
You can add whatever you want to add.
For example, you can change the background, you can set a photo as background. And change the type of the button. You can even reset the system.
